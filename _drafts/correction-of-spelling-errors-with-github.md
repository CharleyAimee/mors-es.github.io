Here we come, my first tutorial <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>. This blog is a sharing place, so I want let edit the content by anyone. And because English is not my mothertongue, I'll probably let sometime some spelling errors on the text. Here I explain how you can help me to correct these errors. For the people who already know Git and GitHub it'll be quite easy, for the others, let's discover the world of *social coding*.

## 1. Create a GitHub account

If you already have one you can skip this part. If not, go to [GitHub.com](http://www.github.com).

Completed the sign-up fields on the home page and clique on the **sign-up** button.

chose the free plan on the second step and finish sign-up.

You have now an GitHub account!

## 2. Let ask to edit a post

On any post of this blog you can find at the bottom an edit-link, Click on it!

<h4>Edit this post on GitHub <i class="fa fa-github"></i></h4>

You will arrive on the MarkDown file of the post on GitHub. All the posts from this blog are writted on MarkDown, if you want to know more about it, go [there](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). The GitHub interface will may seem a little bit messy, but in fact it's not that compliqued. So far, the only thing you have to know it's how you can edit a file. To do that, click on the little pencil on the right.

GitHub create automaticly a fork(= a copy) of the file on your account. There, you can edit the content of the file (you need to know a bit about MarkDown, but as you can see, the raw file is almost the same that the render). If you want to see the look of your changes, click on **Preview changes** (top-left, second tab). There, you'll see in green all the lines you have added, in orange the lines you have modify and in red the lines have deleted, cool no !? When you have finished your changes, you can propose the file change on the bottom of the page. Name your changes, and click on **Propose file change**.

After done that, you'll arrive to the *Comparing changes* page, where you can see the difference between your file and the original one (*Unified* or *Split* mode). If you're ok with the changes, you can click on the **Create pull request** button.

Done, your changes have been send to me. Meanwhile, your changes have been put in the "pull request" part of the Morses's Blog Repository. Anyone can see them or comment them. Thank in advance for your feedback, if you have any question, comment on this post.
